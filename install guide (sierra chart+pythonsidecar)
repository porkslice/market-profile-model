install guide 

in sierra, know your data files foldergo to global settings - general settings - paths - data files folder (usually C:\SierraChart\Data).

This folder will hold the bridge files:
feed_bins.csv (Sierra → Python)
feed_features.csv (Sierra → Python)
results.csv (Python → Sierra)

sierra side (acsil build)
1.Open Sierra → Analysis → New/Open ACSIL File…
2.Create a new file named sierra_chartmarketprofilemodel.cpp and paste the C++ study you got from me (the “Bayesian Profile – Bridge” scaffold).

Build it: Analysis → Build Custom Studies DLL (or F7 → Build).
  After success, the study appears as “Bayesian Profile – Bridge” (that’s the display name inside the code).
  
Add the study to your intraday RTH chart: Analysis → Studies → Add Custom Study.

Chart settings:
  Session Times: set to your RTH.
  Advanced Settings 2 → Enable “Volume at Price Data” (must be ON).
  
Study inputs (good starting values):
  Profile Grid Size: 2 ticks
  Smoothing Sigma (bins): 2.0 (min 1, max 4)
  Opening Range Minutes: 5
  Refresh Seconds: 10
  Output Subfolder: bayes (default)
  Flow Lookback Bars at Levels: 10
  Flow Imbalance Threshold (ratio): 1.8
  Draw VA 50% Credible Band: ON

python sidecar 
Save the Python script as pythonside_marketprofilemodel.py (any folder is fine)

install dependents 
python -m pip install numpy pandas pywavelets scikit-learn

Edit the script: set DATA_DIR to your bayes folder, e.g.
DATA_DIR = r"C:\SierraChart\Data\bayes"

Run it:
python pythonside_marketprofilemodel.py
It watches the two feed files and writes results.csv back into the same folder.

in sierra u should see posterior POC/VA (white) overlay the fallback POC/VA (teal/grey), plus a λmax line.

turn on bid/ask tracking for flow markers 
Chart → Chart Settings → Advanced Settings 2 → Volume at Price Data = ON (you already had this).
Chart → Chart Settings → Advanced Settings 2 → set Intraday Data Storage Time Unit = 1 Tick (best accuracy).
Optional but helpful: Numbers Bars Calculated Values study on the chart for sanity checks.
